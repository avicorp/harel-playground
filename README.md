# harel-playground

This repository contains sample code by Harel. Each app is typically a single HTML file kept inside its own directory. When a project requires additional assets such as images, stylesheets, or scripts, they will be stored alongside the HTML file in that directory.

## Projects

- **animated-site** – a single-page portfolio with an animated gradient background, interactive carousel controls, and SEO-friendly markup
- **balloon-popper** – a balloon popping game
- **space-shooter** – a simple JavaScript arcade game
